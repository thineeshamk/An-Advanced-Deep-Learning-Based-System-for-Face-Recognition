# An Advanced Deep Learning-Based System for Face Recognition

A deep learning-based attendance system that uses facial recognition to identify students. Built with TensorFlow and MobileNetV2, this project automates the attendance process by recognizing student faces from images. It compares different deep learning approaches, including custom CNN and transfer learning, to determine the most effective model for this task.

---

## Project Objectives

- Develop a facial recognition model to identify students and mark attendance.
- Explore three deep learning approaches:
  - Custom CNN from scratch
  - MobileNetV2 with frozen layers
  - MobileNetV2 with fine-tuned custom convolutional layers
- Use data augmentation and preprocessing to improve model performance.
- Evaluate results using accuracy and loss metrics.
- Prepare the system for future real-time deployment using cameras or mobile devices.
- Design and develop a deep learning-based face recognition system for student identification and automated attendance marking.
- Collect and build a custom face dataset consisting of facial images from 10 individual students under various lighting conditions, angles, and expressions to simulate real-world scenarios.
Perform data preprocessing and augmentation, including:
Face detection and alignment
Resizing and normalization
Rotation, flipping, brightness variation
to enhance generalization and model robustness.
Explore and compare multiple deep learning architectures for facial recognition:
A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch
MobileNetV2 with frozen pretrained layers (feature extractor)
MobileNetV2 with fine-tuned custom convolutional layers
Train and evaluate the models using training/validation/testing splits, and analyze performance based on:
Accuracy
Loss
Confusion matrix
Model size and inference time (if real-time deployment is intended)
Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, batch size, dropout) and regularization techniques.
